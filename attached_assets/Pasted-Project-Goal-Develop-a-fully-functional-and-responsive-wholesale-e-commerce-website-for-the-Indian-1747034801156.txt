Project Goal:
Develop a fully functional and responsive wholesale e-commerce website for the Indian market named "Fourkids." The platform will facilitate product sales from the admin to registered wholesale buyers.

Login: Email and Password.

Password Reset functionality.

View products, categories, and promotional banners.

Add products to Watchlist.

Add products to Basket (Cart).

Proceed to a simplified checkout (details TBD, but assume basic for now).

View order history.

Manage profile.

Admin:

Separate Login: Secure admin credentials (username/password).

Dashboard: Overview of sales, users, products.

Product Management:

Upload new products: Name, Description, Multiple Images, SKU, Categories, Wholesale Price, Stock Quantity, Variants (e.g., size, color).

Edit existing products.

II. Website Structure & Design:

A. Global Elements:

Responsiveness: The entire website must be fully responsive and adapt seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Brand:

Shop Name: Fourkids

Logo: To be provided (placeholder for now).

B. Header Section (Two-Tier):

First Header (Top Bar):

Left Side:

"Support" (links to a contact/FAQ page)

"Wholesale Program" (links to a page explaining benefits/terms)

"About Us" (links to an about page)

Middle:

"Fourkids" Logo.

Right Side:

Search Icon/Bar (functional product search).

"Login" Button (changes to "My Account" or User Icon upon login).

Watchlist Icon (with a counter for items).

Basket/Cart Icon (with a counter for items).

Hover Effect: All clickable text links in this header should have an underline hover effect.

Second Header (Navigation Bar):

Middle (Centered):

Dynamic list of main product categories (e.g., "Capri," "Cargo," "Momfit," "Pants," "T-Shirts," "Shirts," etc.). These should be manageable by the admin.

Hover Effect: All category links in this header should have an underline hover effect.

C. Homepage Layout:

Row 1: Promotional Banners (Full width, 2 distinct sections/columns within the row):

Banner 1: Text "FREE SHIPPING ACROSS INDIA"

Banner 2: Text "UNBEATABLE INTERNATIONAL PRICE"

(Consider distinct background colors or subtle visual separation)

Row 2: Value Proposition Banners (Full width, 3 columns):

Column 1: Text "MADE IN INDIA" (perhaps with a relevant icon)

Column 2: Text "ASSURED QUALITY" (perhaps with a relevant icon)

Column 3: Text "TRENDY DESIGNS" (perhaps with a relevant icon)

Row 3: Main Hero Banner Carousel (Full width):

Large, high-quality images (admin should be able to upload/change these).

Each slide can have overlaid text.

Prominently feature a "SHOP NOW" button on each slide, typically on the left side of the image or overlaid strategically. This button should link to a relevant category or product page.

Row 4: "Categories to Bag" Section:

Display main product categories as visually appealing cards.

Each card should have the category name (e.g., "Capri," "Cargo") and ideally a representative image.

Clicking a card navigates the user to that specific category page.

Row 5: "Sample Products" / "Featured Products" Section:

Display a grid of selected products (e.g., 4-8 products).

Each product should be presented as a Product Card (details below).

Row 6: "Why Choose Fourkids?" Section:

Text and potentially an image explaining the benefits of partnering with Fourkids.

Row 7: "Become a Partner of Fourkids" Section:

Call to action, possibly linking to the registration page or a "Wholesale Program" information page.

D. Product Card Design:

Display: Product Image, Product Name, Wholesale Price.

Hover Effect: On mouse hover over the product card:

Subtly change the card's appearance (e.g., slight shadow, border).

Reveal three clickable options/icons:

"Add to Watchlist" (e.g., a heart icon).

"Add to Basket" (e.g., a cart icon or "Add to Cart" button).

"Quick View" (e.g., an eye icon or "Quick View" button).

Quick View should open a modal/popup displaying key product details (images, description, price, add to cart option) without leaving the current page.

E. Category Pages:

Display category name as a heading.

Option for category-specific banner/description (admin-managed).

Grid of products belonging to that category, using the Product Card design.

Sorting options (e.g., by price, newness).
